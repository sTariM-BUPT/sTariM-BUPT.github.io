I'm a second-year Ph.D. student from [School of Computer Science(National Pilot Software Engineering School)](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhonghong Ou](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/ouzhonghong) of CAD Lab from School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
